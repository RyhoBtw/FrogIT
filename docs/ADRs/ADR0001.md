# **ADR 0001 — Use a Dedicated Audio Thread for Low-Latency Playback**
## Context and Problem Statement

FrogIT must play ambient sounds in real time while the user interface remains responsive.  
If audio and UI run on the same thread, audio stutters and UI lag occur.  
**Question:** How can we ensure low-latency audio playback even when the UI is under load?
## Considered Options
- Single-threaded model (UI + audio together)
- Multi-threading with a dedicated audio thread
- External audio backend with real-time prioritization
- Event-based audio processing without its own thread
## Decision
Chosen option: **“Multi-threading with a dedicated audio thread”**, because it is the only option that reliably ensures real-time audio playback while keeping the UI smooth, and it integrates easily with SFML.
## Status
Accepted
## Consequences
- Positive: **Stable, low-latency audio playback**, even under UI load
- Positive: **UI remains responsive**
- Negative: **Higher complexity** due to synchronization and threading
- Negative: Requires **more testing** for race conditions
