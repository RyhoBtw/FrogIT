# **ADR 0002 — Use SFML for Audio and Dear ImGui for the UI**
## Context and Problem Statement
FrogIT needs audio playback, rendering, and UI components. The tools must be lightweight, C++ friendly, and fast to integrate.  
**Question:** Which libraries best support fast development, good performance, and maintainability?
## Considered Options
- SFML + Dear ImGui
- SDL2 + ImGui
- Qt (full framework)
- Custom UI + custom audio backend
## Decision
Chosen option: **“SFML + Dear ImGui”**, because this combination minimizes boilerplate, is easy to learn, is lightweight, open source, and fits the project scope.
## Status
Accepted
## Consequences
- Positive: **Fast prototyping**, minimal complexity
- Positive: **SFML is easy to use** and beginner friendly
- Negative: SFML does **not guarantee the lowest possible audio latency**
- Negative: ImGui is **not a native desktop UI**, it uses an immediate-mode model
