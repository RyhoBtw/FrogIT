# **ADR 0003 — Use JSON as the Format for Saving Presets**
## Context and Problem Statement

**Question:** Which format is best for storing soundscape presets?
## Considered Options
- JSON
- XML
- Binary format
- YAML
- TOML
## Decision
Chosen option: **“JSON”**, because it is simple, human-readable, widely supported, and ideal for configuration data using libraries like nlohmann/json.
## Status
Accepted
## Consequences
- Positive: **Easy debugging** and manual editing
- Positive: Many stable C++ JSON parsers exist
- Negative: JSON is **larger** and slightly **slower** than binary formats
